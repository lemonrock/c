# c

c is a simple project to provide C compatibility code and commonly used idioms for Rust crates which need C wrappers or glue code. It provides a generic Cargo `build.rs` which can be symlinked into place.

c is intended to be used as a submodule under `src/` in a Cargo project

## Usage

If you have a git repository and cargo crate looking like this:-

```
	myrepo/
		.git/
		Cargo.toml
		Cargo.lock
		src/
```

Do the following:-

```bash
cd myrepo
cd src
git submodule add https://github.com/lemonrock/c.git
```

Now simply edit your `Cargo.toml` file to include `build = "src/c/build.rs"` in the `[package]` section, and create `build.h` and `build.c` in `src/`. See the [threading-support](https://github.com/lemonrock/threading-support) project for examples of these files (look in its `src/`).

At some point I'd like to add an `./install` file like that used in [.cargo](https://github.com/lemonrock/.cargo), or, possibly, even move this logic inside `.cargo` and have the `build.rs` file check for the existence of `build.c`.
